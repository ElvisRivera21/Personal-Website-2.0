<!--Content for the about me -->
    <p>I enjoy working out and playing volleyball or golf in my free time. I have two dogs, one is a rescue Pitbull terrier
    mix, and the other is a chihuahua Maltese mix. I recently graduated from Franklin University and obtained my Bachelor of
    Science in Business Administration. I am currently employed with Optum Serve as a Provider Data Analyst. I have been
    with the organization for four years and enjoy helping veterans in my role. I am a Navy veteran and was stationed in
    Norfolk, VA onboard the aircraft carrier USS. Harry S. Truman CVN 75. My main job was to fuel the jets and helicopter on
    the flight deck and to help purify fuel below decks.</p>
